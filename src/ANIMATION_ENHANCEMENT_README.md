## Animation Enhancements

### Edge Animations
- **Active Edge Highlighting**: During simulation, active edges are highlighted with a brighter color and increased stroke width
- **Trail Effect**: Recently active edges remain partially highlighted after the simulation moves on, creating a visual "trail" of the automaton's execution path
- **Animated Edges**: Active edges use animation to indicate direction of traversal
- **Enhanced Markers**: Arrow markers are dynamically styled based on whether the edge is active

### Node Animations
- **Active Node Highlighting**: Currently active states are highlighted with custom colors
- **Initial and Final State Styling**: Clear visual distinction for initial states (different background) and final states (border)
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth transitions between states using CSS transitions

## Infinite Loop Fixes

The application was previously experiencing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors due to infinite render loops. We addressed these issues in all three simulators (DFA, NFA, PDA) with the following optimizations:

### State Memoization
- Added `useMemo` to memoize automaton properties to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Used `JSON.stringify` for complex objects to avoid deep comparison issues
- Implemented proper dependency tracking in `useEffect` and `useCallback` functions

### Component Structure Improvements
- Refactored the components to extract and memoize complex calculations
- Separated UI elements (like modals) into memoized components
- Reduced state updates during renders to prevent cascading updates

### Optimization Examples
```typescript
// Memoize automaton properties 
const automataProps = useMemo(() => ({
  states: automata.states,
  initialState: automata.initialState,
  finalStates: automata.finalStates,
  transitions: automata.transitions
}), [
  automata.states,
  automata.initialState, 
  automata.finalStates,
  JSON.stringify(automata.transitions)
]);

// Memoize generated elements
const generatedNodes = useMemo(() => generateNodes(), [generateNodes]);
const generatedEdges = useMemo(() => generateEdges(), [generateEdges]);
```

## Position Persistence

We implemented a position persistence system to maintain node positions between renders:

- Added a `useRef` to store node positions persistently across renders
- Ensured positions are updated only when nodes are manually moved
- Implemented circle-based initial positioning for better visualization
- Created a robust `handleNodesChange` function to track position changes

```typescript
// Store node positions to persist them between renders
const nodePositions = useRef<Record<string, { x: number, y: number }>>({});

// Handle node changes (including position changes)
const handleNodesChange = useCallback((changes: NodeChange[]) => {
  onNodesChange(changes);
  
  // Update position references for moved nodes
  changes.forEach(change => {
    if (change.type === 'position' && change.position && change.id) {
      nodePositions.current[change.id] = { 
        x: change.position.x, 
        y: change.position.y 
      };
    }
  });
}, [onNodesChange]);
```

## Shared Animation Styles

We created a reusable animation styles hook (`useAnimationStyles.ts`) to ensure consistency across all automaton simulators:

- Centralized styling for edges, nodes, and markers
- Added dark/light mode support
- Implemented functions to generate appropriate styles based on element state
- Applied consistent styling across DFA, NFA, and PDA simulators

### The Animation Hook Provides:
- `getEdgeStyle`: Generates edge styles based on active state
- `getMarkerStyle`: Manages arrow marker styles
- `getLabelStyle`: Handles label presentation
- `getNodeStyle`: Applies appropriate node styling

## StrictMode Protection

We implemented protection against the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error that was occurring in React's StrictMode (which intentionally double-invokes functions to catch side effects). Our solution includes:

### Update Guards
```typescript
// Use this ref to avoid double effects in StrictMode
const updatingRef = useRef(false);
  
// Update nodes and edges when needed
useEffect(() => {
  // Guard against concurrent renders in React StrictMode
  if (updatingRef.current) return;
  updatingRef.current = true;
  
  const update = () => {
    try {
      setNodes(generatedNodes);
      setEdges(generatedEdges);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error updating nodes/edges", error);
    } finally {
      updatingRef.current = false;
    }
  };

  const timeoutId = setTimeout(update, 10);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [generatedNodes, generatedEdges, setNodes, setEdges]);
```

### Simplified Type Definitions
Due to complex typing issues with the ReactFlow library, we simplified our node types to avoid conflicts:

```typescript
// Define a simpler node type to avoid complex typing issues
type SimpleNode = {
  id: string;
  data: { label: string };
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  draggable?: boolean;
  style?: React.CSSProperties;
  sourcePosition?: Position;
  targetPosition?: Position;
};
```

### Fixing Circular Dependencies
We eliminated circular dependencies that caused infinite loops:
- Removed the redundant `useEffect` that updated nodePositions whenever nodes changed
- Ensured `nodePositions` are only updated in the `handleNodesChange` function
- Used timeouts to break synchronous update cycles
- Applied batched updates to prevent cascading state changes

## Maintaining Draggability

We ensured node draggability was preserved while adding animation enhancements:

- The `nodesDraggable` property is set to `true` in the ReactFlow component
- Node positions are properly tracked and updated through the `handleNodesChange` function
- Style properties that could interfere with dragging were carefully managed

## Further Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:

1. Adding animation speed control
2. Implementing step-by-step execution mode
3. Adding the ability to export/import automaton layouts
4. Optimizing for larger automata with many states
5. Adding tooltips to explain transitions during simulation

These enhancements have significantly improved both the visual appeal and performance of the Automata-Verse application. The simulators now provide a more intuitive and responsive experience for users.
